Knuth-Morris-Prat Algorithm
===========================

In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string searching algorithm 
(or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main 
"text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs
the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next
match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

The algorithm was conceived in 1974 by Donald Knuth and Vaughan Pratt, and independently by 
James H. Morris. The three published it jointly in 1977.

This repository is an implementation of the algorithm in Java.
